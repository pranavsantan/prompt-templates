# GenAI Project Design Document Prompt

You are an expert solutions architect and technical writer. 
Your task is to generate a comprehensive **Project Design Document** for a Generative AI–powered knowledge assistant.

This assistant will help analysts who are not familiar with SQL learn to:
- Write SQL queries
- Pull the right data
- Build dashboards on Databricks

The assistant should use GPT-5 with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup that pulls domain-specific knowledge and documentation.

When writing the design document, please include the following sections and use the **starter content** provided to expand into a professional document. Use placeholders where necessary so I can fill in my organization’s specifics.

## 1. Executive Summary  
This project aims to build a Generative AI assistant that empowers non-SQL analysts to query data and create dashboards directly in Databricks. The solution reduces dependency on technical data teams, accelerates insights, and helps democratize data access. By combining GPT-5 with a RAG pipeline, the assistant will provide accurate, context-aware SQL generation and guided dashboard creation.

---

## 2. Problem Statement & Objectives  
- **Current Challenges:** Many analysts lack SQL expertise, leading to delays in creating reports and over-reliance on specialized data engineers.  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Reduce query turnaround time by XX%.  
  - Enable XX% of analysts to self-serve dashboards within 3 months.  
  - Improve trust in data-driven decision-making across business teams.

---

## 3. Target Users & Personas  
- **Primary Persona:** Business Analysts with limited SQL knowledge but strong domain expertise.  
- **Secondary Persona:** BI Developers who can validate and refine queries.  
- **Pain Points:**  
  - Reliance on data engineers for every new question.  
  - Frustration with learning SQL syntax.  
  - Limited knowledge of where data lives in Databricks.

---

## 4. System Architecture & Components  
- **LLM:** GPT-5 hosted on Databricks Model Serving or via OpenAI Responses API.  
- **RAG Flow:**  
  - Document sources: internal data dictionaries, SQL query patterns, governance docs.  
  - Vector store: Databricks Vector Search.  
  - Retrieval layer integrated with GPT-5.  
- **Integration:**  
  - Connects with Databricks SQL endpoints.  
  - Pulls schema metadata from Unity Catalog.  
  - Generates dashboards in Databricks SQL.  

---

## 5. Data Sources & Knowledge Base  
- **Content:**  
  - Data catalog from Unity Catalog.  
  - Internal BI/SQL best practice guides.  
  - Frequently asked business queries.  
- **Governance:** Access restricted by user role; sensitive data excluded.  
- **Update Frequency:** Weekly ingestion pipeline via Databricks Workflows.

---

## 6. User Experience & Workflow  
**Example Flow:**  
1. Analyst: *“Show me quarterly revenue by region.”*  
2. Assistant: Generates draft SQL using table metadata.  
3. Analyst: Reviews and confirms.  
4. Assistant: Suggests visualizations and creates dashboard in Databricks SQL.  
5. Analyst: Publishes dashboard to team workspace.  

---

## 7. Security & Compliance  
- Enforce Unity Catalog permissions; assistant cannot bypass RBAC.  
- Query sandboxing to prevent destructive actions (e.g., `DROP`, `ALTER`).  
- Logging of assistant interactions for compliance audits.  

---

## 8. Performance & Evaluation  
- **Metrics:**  
  - SQL accuracy rate (target: 90%).  
  - User adoption rate (XX% within 6 months).  
  - Reduction in support tickets for SQL help.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Offline evaluation with benchmark queries.  
  - Human-in-the-loop validation during pilot.

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations  
- **Risk:** Assistant generates incorrect or inefficient queries.  
  - *Mitigation:* Implement confidence scoring and require human review above thresholds.  
- **Risk:** Users over-rely on assistant.  
  - *Mitigation:* Provide inline learning tips to build SQL literacy.  

---

## 10. Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Prototype assistant with basic SQL generation.  
- **Phase 2 (Pilot):** Deploy to a small analyst group with limited scope (e.g., finance dashboards).  
- **Phase 3 (Full Rollout):** Organization-wide release with governance and training.  
- **Timeline:** XX months (fill in specifics).  

---

## 11. Future Enhancements  
- Personalization based on user history and query style.  
- Multi-modal input (voice queries, natural language dashboards).  
- Expansion to external BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).

Please expand each section into a full professional design document. Where placeholders (XX, [organization name], [timeline]) appear, leave them as-is so I can fill in my own details later.
